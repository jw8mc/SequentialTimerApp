## Sequential Timer Application

With this individual project, I hope to create a sequential timer application (for Windows desktop), with the goal of providing an easily configured staging environment for people who struggle with executive disfunction. This app would allow you to set alarms to go off in order, and set delay timers to give yourself time to complete the tasks before the next alarm begins.

Stretch goals include pulling in the Google Calendar API and giving users a summary of upcoming events, and developing this into a mobile app for Android.
